The files are also visible to all participants in the chat. It is therefore advisable to encrypt confidential documents. &lt;br&gt; Remember that it is a good idea to compress files to take up less space and reduce upload and download times. &lt;br&gt; Also files with extension &lt;b&gt; * .com &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; *. exe &lt;/b&gt; are renamed to &lt;b&gt; respectively *. co_ &lt;/b&gt; and &lt; b&gt; *. ex_ &lt;/b&gt; To run these files you need to download them and rename the extension. We recommend that you check them with an antivirus before doing so. &lt;/P&gt;</item>
